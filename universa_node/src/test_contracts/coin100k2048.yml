     description: >
       This contract represent a on-time emission of a coin-like object, that could be split to pieces up to the
       specified amount (like small changed) or joined back. This contract does not allow emit more joinable coins.
       Unlike paper money, this contrace is singlue emission only. Coins of this type could be only split from this
       contract, and the joined together to form any necessary sum.

  # required. time of contract creation. must not be in the futute or too long in the past (few days are allowed,
  # consult current Universa state, maximum delayed contract creation time varies. This time we make a template
  # which will be substituted by the creation time on issuing client:

  # will keep the time of root contract creation
  created_at: now()

  # required key, can be empty if the contract uses only standard roles, issues and creator.
  roles:
   # no extra roles, issuer and owner are predefined, so empty list.

  # required key, if left empty, the contract can not be changed or revoked. Be careful.
  permissions:
     # owner have a right to transfer ownership. Note that if the creator will be mentioned here, only the creator
     # will have permission to change owner. It is very important to allow it, so the owner can pay with a coin, or
     # split a part of it for another beneficiary
    change_owner: owner

    # This is a main permission of money-like contract
    split_join:
      # owner can split and join coins, e.g. manipulate to pay and receive payments.

      # is also limited (a useful option):
      - role: owner
        # Mimimum splittable value. It means that we can split 10 coints to 9.99 and 0.01. Note that the system now
        # only allow values not lessser tha. 0.000`000`001, e.g. 1E-9, 1 nano-unit of something.
        min_value: 0.01 # one cent is a minimum
        # all split values must not differ to a value less than this unit. Actually, it should always
        # be a power of 10, like 0.0001 The system checks that any split value's ULP is no less than that
        # (ULP is Unit in Last Position, common term. For example ULP(117.223) is 0.001
        # is greated tham this. In our case, it allows splitting 10 to 5.001 and 4.999, but not to 5.1234 and 4.9866
        # as the ulp will be 0.0001 for 4.8966. In most cases it is practical to have same min_unit and to min_value
        # as the 10th power
        min_unit: 0.001

        # The name of the field to change
        field_name: amount

        # this way we forbid any later emissions: only parts from this contract could be joined.
        # adding other field to this allow additional emission:
        join_match_fields:
          - state.origin

    # who can revoke the contract: owner, and issuer altogether. Usually it means - when the issuer posess the contract
    # for example by bying it back from the customer, it is possible ro revoke it. Very much like destroying banknotes
    # by its owner - but we require also issuer signature on it:
    revoke:
      - issuer
      - owner
#      - role:
#        name: list_role
#        type: ALL_OF
#        roles:
#          - issuer
#          - owner

  # required section, could be empty. Any immutable structured data issuer might need to include into the contract
  # this data will be also copied without change during any contract changes.
  data:
    # optional, but almost always needed name or four currency
    name: Test cryptocurrency
    # optional, we recommend this field to be defined in a practical and meamningful way to avoid future collisions

    # the human-readable version of currency-code
    currency_name: Test Univerca Cryptocurrencty

    description: this contract emits initial amount of test cryptocurrency to be payable just like electronic money

# required section. Data that represent current contract state, could be modified in accordance with

state:
 # required. most often, we should specify contract owner. we could specify 'issuer' or provide a key
